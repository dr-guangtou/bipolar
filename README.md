# BiPolar 

* This is my attempt to learn how to:
1. Speed-up native Python code using JIT (e.g. `Numba`)
2. Interface between Python and C/C++ (hence "Bi"-Polar)
  - `Python/C API`, `Ctypes`, `Cython`, `PyBind11`, etc.
3. Write decent unit tests (following the [LSST/DM developer guide](https://developer.lsst.io/index.html)
4. Learn how to use `Sphinx` document and setup a document website.

* The goal is to have a simple function to convert a 2-D image from Cartesian coordinate into a polar coordinate. But I will try to achieve this in many different ways, using both Python or C/C++ as "core". I will profile them and do benchmark test on them.

* This is a side project, so can only make slow progress.
